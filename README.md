# Location Lookup

This .NET Core Web API shows how to implement an asynchronous workflow to geocode a given location using MassTransit.

## Description

There are three parts to this project:  a .NET Core Web API, a .NET Core worker, and a models project.

## Requirements

.NET Core
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
A PC*Miler Web Services API Key ([get one here](https://developer.trimblemaps.com/))

## Running the project

This solution relies on a RabbitMQ instance running inside a Docker container. To launch the container, navigate to the `deployment` directory and run the following command in a command prompt:

```powershell
docker compose up -d
```

Next, open the solution in Visual Studio and launch both the Location.API and Location.Worker projects.

When complete, run the following command in the `deployment` directory to stop the RabbitMQ container:

```powershell
docker compose down
```
